This is my first blog post. I wrote it with MDX!

Hi.

So hereâ€™s my current problem.

I want my web app to use images uploaded from users and with the crazy resolutions from phones nowadays we can get an idea of how bad it can get. ðŸ˜…

So my plan is this:

Multer to handle the upload.
Tinypng to compress the images
Cloudinary to serve and store the compressed images
All of this will be tied on a Mongo, Express and Node package.

Wish me luck!
