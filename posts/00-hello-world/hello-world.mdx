This is my next blog post. I wrote it with MDX!

![Hello Image](images/estee-janssens.jpg)

Today I would like to share a minor quirk I found while implementing a google map for a project.

I like to do some minor user experience type test on my code to adapt it and make it comfortable to use.

While developing the map I found that when we create it with Place Autocomplete, although it correctly, well sometimes ðŸ˜…, predicts what you want on the first try, it doesnâ€™t auto select the first option when pressing Enter. ðŸ¤¨
